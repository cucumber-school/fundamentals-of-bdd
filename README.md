## Compilation

To compile the project into a set of HTML files, run the following command:

```
  rake "html"
```

This will produce an html file under `public/<language>/index.html` for each available language.

You can list all available languages with:

```
  rake list
```

To compile only the files for a specific language, you can pass an argument to the `html` rake task, like this:

```
  rake "html[ruby]"
```
