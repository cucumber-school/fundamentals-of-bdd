=== Literal expressions

Let’s look at the Shouty scenario from the last chapter.

.hear_shout.feature
[source,gherkin]
----
Feature: Hear shout
  Scenario: Listener is within range
    Given Lucy is located 15 metres from Sean
    When Sean shouts "free bagels at Sean's"
    Then Lucy hears Sean’s message
----

As Cucumber starts to execute this feature, it will come to the first step of the scenario `Given Lucy is 15 metres from Sean` and say to itself "now - do I have any step definitions that match the phrase "Lucy is 15 metres from Sean`?”"

The most simple cucumber expression that would match that step is this one:

----
Lucy is 15 metres from Sean
----

That’s pretty simple isn’t it? Cucumber expressions are just string patterns, and the most simple pattern you can use is a perfect match.

In Ruby, we can use this pattern to make a step definition like this:

[source, ruby]
----
Given 'Lucy is 15 metres from Sean' do
  # TODO: automation code to place Lucy and Sean goes here
  puts "matched!"
end
----

We use a normal Ruby string to pass the cucumber expression to Cucumnber.
