Let's look at the Shouty scenario from the last chapter.

.hear_shout.feature
[source,gherkin]
include::../code/ruby/02-simple-literal-expression/features/hear_shout.feature[]

As Cucumber starts to execute this feature, it will come to the first step of the scenario `Given Lucy is 15 metres from Sean` and say to itself "now - do I have any step definitions that match the phrase "Lucy is 15 metres from Sean`?”"

The most simple cucumber expression that would match that step is this one:

----
Lucy is located 15 metres from Sean
----

rhat’s pretty simple isn't it? Cucumber expressions are just string patterns, and the most simple pattern you can use is a perfect match.

In Ruby, we can use this pattern to make a step definition like this:

[source, ruby]
include::../code/ruby/02-simple-literal-expression/features/step_definitions/steps.rb[lines=3..6]

We use a normal Ruby string to pass the cucumber expression to Cucumnber.
