Now that we have the step definitions matching, we can start working on our solution. We like to use our scenarios to _guide_ our development, so we'll start designing the objects we'll need by sketching out some code in our step definitions.

The scenario will be failing while we do this, but we should see the error messages gradually progressing as we drive out the interface to our object model.

Our next goal is for the scenario to fail because we need to implement the actual business logic. _Then_ we can work on changing the business logic inside our objects to make it pass.

.StepDefinitions.java
[source,java]
----
public class StepDefinitions {
    @Given("Lucy is {int} metres from Sean")
    public void lucy_is_metres_from_Sean(Integer distance) {
        System.out.println(distance);
        throw new io.cucumber.java.PendingException();
    }

    @When("Sean shouts {string}")
    public void sean_shouts(String string) {
        // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
        throw new io.cucumber.java.PendingException();
    }

    @Then("Lucy should hear Sean's message")
    public void lucy_should_hear_Sean_s_message() {
        // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
        throw new io.cucumber.java.PendingException();
    }
}
----

To implement the first step, we need to create a couple of `Person` objects, one for Lucy shot::[2] and one for Sean.shot::[3]

[source,java]
----
public class StepDefinitions {
    Person lucy = new Person();
    Person sean = new Person();

    // ...
}
----


Then we create the `Person` class to remove the errors.shot::[4]

[source,java]
----
package shouty;

public class Person {
}
----

And specify the distance between them.


We can remove the `pending` status now, and this print statement,shot::[5] and write the implementation for the first step like this:

[source,java]
----
public class StepDefinitions {
    Person lucy = new Person();
    Person sean = new Person();

    @Given("Lucy is {int} metres from Sean")
    public void lucy_is_metres_from_Sean(Integer distance) {
        lucy.moveTo(distance);
    }

    // ...
}
----

And create the `moveTo` method in the `Person` class. shot::[6]

[source,java]
----
package shouty;

public class Person {
    public void moveTo(Integer distance) {

    }
}
----

We have two instances of person, one representing Lucy, shot::[7]and one representing Sean. shot::[8]Then we call a method to move Lucy to the position specified in the scenario.shot::[9]

When we run the scenario, the first step is green!

Process finished with exit code 0

We're making progress!

We'll keep working like this until we see the scenario failing for the right reasons.

In the second step definition, we want to tell Sean to shout something.

shot::[11]
In order to send instructions to Sean from the second step, we need to store him in an _instance variable_, so that he’ll be accessible from all of our step definitions. In IntelliJ we can do this by using the _Introduce Field_ refactoring.

shot::[12]
In the `When` step, we're capturing Sean's message using the `{string}` pattern, so let's give that argument a more meaningful name.shot::[13]

shot::[14]
And now we can now tell him to _shout_ the message:

[source,java]
----
public class StepDefinitions {
    Person lucy = new Person();
    Person sean = new Person();

    // ...

    @When("Sean shouts {string}")
    public void sean_shouts(String message) {
        sean.shout(message);
    }

    // ...
}
----

And we eliminate the compilation error by implementing the `shout` message in the `Person` class.

[source,java]
----
package shouty;

public class Person {

    public void moveTo(Integer distance) {

    }

    public void shout(String message) {

    }
}
----

When we run the scenarion again, now the second step is green!. shot::[15]

shot::[16]
The last step definition is where we implement a check, or assertion. We'll verify that what Lucy has heard is exactly the same as what Sean shouted.

shot::[17]
Once again we're going to write the code we wish we had.

[source,java]
----
@Then("Lucy should hear Sean's message")
public void lucy_should_hear_Sean_s_message() {
    assertEquals(asList(messageFromSean), lucy.getMessagesHeard());
}
----

In order for this to be able to compile, we need to import the `assertEquals` static method from `JUnit` shot::[18]  and the `Array.asList` method. shot::[19]

So we need a way to ask Lucy what messages she's heard, and we also need to know what it was that Sean shouted.

We can record what Sean shouts by storing it in an instance variable as the `When` step runs. shot::[21] shot::[22] This is a common pattern to use in Cucumber step definitions when you don’t want to repeat the same test data in different parts of a scenario. Now we can use that in the assertion check. shot::[23]

[source,java]
----
@When("Sean shouts {string}")
public void sean_shouts(String message) {
    sean.shout(message);
    messageFromSean = message;
 }
----

We also need to add a `messagesHeard` method to our Person class.shot::[24] Let's do that now, we'll just return null for now.shot::[25]

[source,java]
----
package shouty;

import java.util.List;

public class Person {

    public void moveTo(Integer distance) {

    }

    public void shout(String message) {

    }

    public List<String> getMessagesHeard() {
        return null;
    }
}
----

...and watch Cucumber run the tests again.shot::[26]

This is great! Whenever we do BDD, getting to our first failing test is a milestone. Seeing the test fail proves that it is capable of detecting errors in our code!

Never trust an automated test that you haven’t seen fail!

Now all we have to do is write the code to make it do what it's supposed to.
